Our form builder comes with all the powerful form fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

* Phone number
* Hidden fields
* User ID

With our built-in form styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your contact forms. With just a few clicks, your contact form and advanced forms can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, Formidable applies a single styling template to all contact forms and advanced forms on your site. But if you want to have custom form style for each individual contact form and registration form, then you can upgrade to Formidable Forms Pro.

= Complete Entry Management for Contact Forms and Surveys =

Formidable Forms allows you to view all your contact form and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard.

Once a user submits your contact form, their response is automatically stored in your WordPress database. 

Formidable Forms is **100% GDPR-friendly**. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving form submissions entirely. Alternatively, you can add a GDPR checkbox field to your form to collect consent.

Need to import your contact form leads to another service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export contact form leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, and import anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited form email notifications and autoresponders. 

On top of that, you can easily customize the contact form success message the user sees after they submit the form, or completely redirect them to another page for your more advanced form needs.

= Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports = 

Aside from simple contact forms, Formidable comes with a built-in survey feature, so you can quickly create powerful surveys and see beautiful reports.

The best part is that you can do this all within Formidable without using any third-party tools.

= Quickly Create Advanced Registration Forms for Any Use Case = 

Whether you need to create a youth sport team registration form, event registration form, or church retreat registration form, Formidable has got you covered.

Unlike other contact form plugins, Formidable Forms comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the most powerful registration forms.

Then, you can use our marketing integrations and APIs to send this form data anywhere you want.

= Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments =

We're on a mission to offer an all-in-one solution focused WordPress form plugin, so you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your contact form maker plugin to do everything that you want.

= Extend and Customize Your Forms - Developer's Dream Come True = 

Formidable is the form plugin of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies because it helps them build complex form solutions quickly and defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. We believe big projects don't always need big resources.

= My contact forms are not sending emails. Why not? =

When you do not receive emails from your contact forms, try the following steps:

   1. Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in your Email form action on the form "Settings" page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...). If these emails don't work on your site, form emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box
   4. Try a different email address in your contact form settings.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If none of these steps fix the problem with your form emails, and other WP emails are also not going out, please contact your web host.
